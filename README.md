Insulin remains essential for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and common among people with type 2 diabetes. Insulin prices in the United States have tripled over the past decade,1 particularly in the context of insulin analog prescriptions;2 the insulin price increases have been linked to cost-related insulin underuse and “stretching” of insulin prescriptions (e.g., using fewer units per day to make a vial last longer) among people with type 1 and with type 2 diabetes, which may produce both short-term risks of hypo- or hyper-glycemia as well as long-term risks of microvascular events.3 Insulin cost regulatory measures have been proposed, and include capping patient copayments for insulin purchases, instituting international reference pricing standards, or encouraging expanded manufacturing to more suppliers using regulatory powers that usurp patent rules, among other policies.4,5 Insulin manufacturing stimulus strategies, to increase supply and reduce unit price, would require a detailed understanding of insulin needs for the population. Estimating insulin need in the present and future at a population level is dependent on understanding what therapies may achieve different glycemic control targets (both in terms of insulin dosing and--for people with type 2 diabetes--in terms of insulin-preceding oral therapies), and what insulin dosing may be needed to avoid both over-treatment and under-treatment.6 
In this study, we sought to estimate present and future population-level insulin need and use among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States. We sought to compare reported utilization to estimates of need based on weight-based dosing, using data from nationally-representative repeated cross-sectional surveys. We used a microsimulation model to incorporate projections of future type 2 diabetes prevalence in the United States, titration of oral hypoglycemics and treatment with insulin under alternative targets for glycemic control, and identification of populations with potential over-treatment or under-treatment when comparing reported insulin utilization to expected weight-based dosing need estimates.
