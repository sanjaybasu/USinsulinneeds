Insulin remains essential for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and frequently prescribed for people with type 2 diabetes. Insulin prices in the United States have tripled over the past decade,1 particularly given the increasing frequency of insulin analog prescriptions.2 Insulin price increases have been linked to cost-related insulin underuse and “stretching” of insulin prescriptions (e.g., patients using fewer units per day to make a vial last longer), which may produce both short-term risks of hypo- or hyper-glycemia as well as long-term risks of microvascular events.3 Insulin cost regulatory measures have been proposed, and include capping patient copayments for insulin purchases, instituting international reference pricing standards, or encouraging expanded manufacturing to more suppliers using regulatory powers that usurp patent rules, among other policies.4–6 Insulin manufacturing stimulus strategies, to increase supply and reduce unit price, require a detailed understanding of insulin needs for the population. In turn, estimates of population-level insulin need depend upon on understanding the impact of various therapies on levels of glycemic control (both in terms of insulin dosing, i.e., what dose of insulin will result in a specific level of glycemic control, and--for people with type 2 diabetes--in terms of the impact of non-insulin therapies on glycemic control), and what insulin dosing is optimal to avoid both over-treatment and under-treatment.7 
	In this study, we sought to estimate present and future population-level insulin need and dispensation among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States. We sought to compare reported insulin dispensed per person to the estimates of insulin need based on projected insulin dosing from a weight-based estimate of need, applied to data from nationally-representative repeated cross-sectional surveys. We used a microsimulation model to incorporate projections of future type 2 diabetes prevalence in the United States, titration of non-insulin hypoglycemics, and treatment with insulin under alternative targets for glycemic control.
